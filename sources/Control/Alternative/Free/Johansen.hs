-- | Johansen-esque Free Alternative, i.e.:
--
-- * left-associated
-- * topmost-is-rightmost
-- * no @flip@ping (argument order is preserved)
-- * no @uncurry@ing/@curry@ing
--
-- luckily, the property I want (i.e. topmost-is-rightmost, which is not implied by left-associated) also allows the most natural definition (i.e. no flipping or uncurrying). (see "Commands.Parse.gparser"). that is, while the context-sensitive parser induced by a free-alternative-based grammar parses left to right, the context is threaded right to left. thus, the parser-generator is evaluated right to left: it peaks at, and evaluates, the rightmost grammar first; only once it has generated the parser from the rightmost grammar, can it generate the parser of the grammar to the left.
--
-- store the 'alternatives' as a 'Tree', not a list:
--
-- * the associativity (of '<|>') is preserved and explicit
-- * the distributivity (of '<|>' over '<*>') is "undistributed"/"breadth-first", not "distributed"/"depth-first"
--
--     * this matters with infinitely-many alternatives, which motivated this design
--     * we want to be able to evaluate possibly-infinite alternative-expressions by "short-circuiting", rather than the evaluation not terminating by "flattening". e.g.
--
--          finitely:
--
--          @
--          x && (y || z) = (x && y) || (x && z)
--          @
--
--          but infinitely, for example:
--
--          @
--          False && (False || False || ...) â‰  (False && False) || (False && False) || ...
--          @
--
--          because the left one terminates (@== False@) while the right one doesn't.
--
--          This example is for intuition; an equivalent situation shows up from recursively-defined parsers. e.g. (in pseudo-DSL):
--
--          @
--          command = (Undo \<$ "undo") \<|> (Repeat \<$> number \<*> command)
--          @
--
--          where a failing parse is equivalent to @False@ and '<*>' is equivalent to @&&@.
--
--
-- __tl;dr__ lists are flat trees; handle infinitely-many alternatives with a 'Tree' of 'Alternative's.
